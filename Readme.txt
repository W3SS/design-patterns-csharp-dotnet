1) Creational Design Patterns

- In plain words

	Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

- Wikipedia says

	In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, 
	trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 
	The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. 
	Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

2) Structural Design Patterns

- In plain words

	Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. 
	Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

- Wikipedia says

	In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying 
	a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
