- Real world example

	Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning

- In plain words

	Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

- Wikipedia says

	The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. 
	It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, 
	which is cloned to produce new objects.

- In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, 
  instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.

- When to use?

	When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.
